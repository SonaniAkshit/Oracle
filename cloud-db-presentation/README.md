# Cloud Databases Presentation

This folder contains a presentation on **Cloud Databases** with examples from AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure.  
The focus is on the **architectures of individual databases** and an **overview of all database services provided by each cloud platform**.

## ðŸ“‘ Slide Topics & Coverage

1. **Cloud Databases**  
   Opening slide introducing AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure database services.  

2. **Introduction to Cloud Databases**  
   What cloud databases are, why they are used, and how they are provisioned in managed cloud environments.  

3. **AWS Databases Overview**  
   List of databases offered by AWS:  
   - RDS (Relational)  
   - DynamoDB (NoSQL)  
   - Aurora  
   - Redshift  
   - ElastiCache  
   - Neptune (Graph DB)  

4. **AWS â€“ RDS (Relational Database Service)**  
   RDS architecture: database instances, replication, storage layer, failover, and backups.  

5. **AWS â€“ DynamoDB (NoSQL)**  
   Architecture: partitions, key-value/document model, storage and replication, auto-scaling.  

6. **Google Cloud Databases Overview**  
   Services overview:  
   - Cloud SQL (Relational)  
   - Firestore (NoSQL)  
   - Bigtable (Wide-column NoSQL)  
   - Spanner (Globally distributed relational DB)  
   - Memorystore (In-memory)  

7. **Google Cloud â€“ Cloud SQL**  
   Architecture: supported engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server), high availability, storage, replication.  

8. **Google Cloud â€“ Firestore**  
   Architecture: collections, documents, real-time sync, partitioning/sharding, scalability.  

9. **Which Database Should I Use? (Google Cloud)**  
   Use cases for each database:  
   - **Cloud SQL** â†’ Traditional applications needing relational schemas (e.g., ERP, CRM, transactional apps).  
   - **Firestore** â†’ Mobile/web apps requiring real-time sync and flexible document storage (e.g., chat apps, to-do lists).  
   - **Bigtable** â†’ Large-scale analytical or time-series data (e.g., IoT sensor data, financial tick data).  
   - **Spanner** â†’ Global-scale relational applications with strong consistency (e.g., banking, e-commerce).  

10. **Azure Databases Overview**  
   Services overview:  
   - SQL Database (Relational)  
   - Cosmos DB (Multi-model NoSQL)  
   - PostgreSQL (Flexible Server/Single Server)  
   - MySQL (Flexible Server/Single Server)  
   - MariaDB  
   - Azure Synapse Analytics  

11. **Azure â€“ SQL Database**  
   Architecture: logical servers, elastic pools, compute tiers, auto-scaling, and backup/restore.  

12. **Azure â€“ Cosmos DB**  
   Architecture: global distribution, partitioning, consistency levels, API models (SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table).  

13. **Cloud Product Map (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)**  
   Cross-platform comparison of database services with a visual product map.  

14. **Thank You!**  
   Closing slide.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Show the **different database services** each cloud platform offers.  
- Explain the **architectures** of selected relational and NoSQL services.  
- Provide **real-world use cases** for Google Cloud databases.  
- Help learners compare cloud platforms using the product map.

## ðŸ§° How to Use

1. Open the presentation (`pptx` or `pdf`).  
2. Review the **overview slides** to see all services offered by each cloud platform.  
3. Study the **architecture slides** for deeper insights into RDS, DynamoDB, Cloud SQL, Firestore, SQL Database, and Cosmos DB.  
4. Use the **use cases in Slide 9** to guide database selection in real-world projects.  
5. Refer to the product map for a quick side-by-side comparison.
