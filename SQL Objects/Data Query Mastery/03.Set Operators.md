# **üìå Oracle SET OPERATORS**

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What are Set Operators?**

Set operators combine the **results of two or more `SELECT` statements** into a single result set.

üìå Key Points:

* Both queries must have the **same number of columns**.
* Columns must have **compatible data types**.
* The column names in the final result are taken from the **first query**.
* **ORDER BY** can only be used **once at the end**.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Types of Set Operators in Oracle**

| Operator      | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **UNION**     | Returns **all distinct** rows from both queries.               |
| **UNION ALL** | Returns **all rows** from both queries (including duplicates). |
| **INTERSECT** | Returns rows **common to both** queries.                       |
| **MINUS**     | Returns rows from the first query **not in the second**.       |

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Syntax**

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table1
[WHERE condition]
<SET_OPERATOR>
SELECT column_list
FROM table2
[WHERE condition]
ORDER BY column;
```

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Examples**

---

### **A) UNION**

Get a list of all cities where **either customers or suppliers** are located (no duplicates).

```sql
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION
SELECT city FROM suppliers
ORDER BY city;
```

‚úÖ Removes duplicates.

---

### **B) UNION ALL**

Get a list of all cities for customers and suppliers (with duplicates).

```sql
SELECT city FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT city FROM suppliers
ORDER BY city;
```

‚úÖ Faster than UNION because it **does not remove duplicates**.

---

### **C) INTERSECT**

Get cities that **both customers and suppliers** have in common.

```sql
SELECT city FROM customers
INTERSECT
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
```

---

### **D) MINUS**

Get cities where customers are located **but not suppliers**.

```sql
SELECT city FROM customers
MINUS
SELECT city FROM suppliers;
```

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Column Matching Rules**

Both queries must:

* Have **same number of columns**.
* Have **same or compatible data types**.
* **Order of columns** must match.

‚úÖ Example:

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
UNION
SELECT supplier_name, contact_name FROM suppliers;
```

Both return 2 columns of type `VARCHAR2`.

## **6Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Tips**

* `UNION ALL` is faster than `UNION` (no sorting for duplicates).
* Avoid `ORDER BY` inside each query ‚Äî use it only once at the end.
* When using large datasets, index the join columns for better performance.
