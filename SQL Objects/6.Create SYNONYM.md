## ✅ **What is a Synonym in Oracle?**

A **synonym** is an alias for another database object such as a table, view, sequence, procedure, etc.

🟢 **Purpose:**

* Simplifies object access (shorter names)
* Hides object ownership (security)
* Useful in cross-schema access

---

## 🧱 **Basic Syntax**

```sql
CREATE [PUBLIC] SYNONYM synonym_name FOR schema.object_name;
```

* If `PUBLIC` is used → it’s accessible by **all users**
* If no `PUBLIC` → it’s a **private synonym**, visible only to the user who created it

---

## 🧾 **Example 1: Private Synonym**

Let’s say user `AKSHIT` has a table called `products`, and you're logged in as user `USER1`.

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM prod FOR akshit.products;
```

Now, as `USER1`, you can:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prod;
```

Instead of always typing:

```sql
SELECT * FROM akshit.products;
```

---

## 🧾 **Example 2: Public Synonym**

```sql
CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM all_products FOR akshit.products;
```

Now **any user** in the database can:

```sql
SELECT * FROM all_products;
```

> 🔐 You must have `CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM` privilege (typically DBA role) to do this.

---

## ❌ **Drop Synonyms**

### Drop Private Synonym:

```sql
DROP SYNONYM prod;
```

### Drop Public Synonym:

```sql
DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM all_products;
```

## ✅ When to Use

| Use Case                             | Synonym Type | Notes                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Shorten long or schema-prefixed name | Private      | Created per-user                          |
| Share object name access globally    | Public       | Requires DBA privileges                   |
| Cross-schema development             | Either       | Useful when devs work in multiple schemas |

---

## 🚫 Notes & Limitations

* Synonyms don’t carry privileges — **you still need object access**.
* You cannot create a synonym for an object that doesn’t exist.
* Dropping the original object **invalidates** the synonym.

| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create private synonym | `CREATE SYNONYM prod FOR akshit.products;`                |
| Create public synonym  | `CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM all_products FOR akshit.products;` |
| Drop private synonym   | `DROP SYNONYM prod;`                                      |
| Drop public synonym    | `DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM all_products;`                       |

The error you're getting:

```
ORA-01031: insufficient privileges
```

means that the **current user does not have the privilege to create a synonym** for another user's object.

---

## 🔍 Reason

You're trying to create a **private synonym** pointing to `projectuser.products`, but:

1. Your current user **does not have the `CREATE SYNONYM` system privilege**, or
2. You haven’t been **granted access to `projectuser.products`**

---

## ✅ How to Fix It

### 🔹 **Step 1: Grant Object Access** (Must be done by `projectuser`)

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON products TO your_user;
```

Replace `your_user` with your actual Oracle username.

---

### 🔹 **Step 2: Grant Create Synonym Privilege** (DBA must do this)

```sql
GRANT CREATE SYNONYM TO your_user;
```

> ✅ If you're using a personal Oracle DB, log in as a DBA or SYSDBA user (e.g., `sys`) and run the above.

---

### 🔹 **Step 3: Create the Synonym** (Once privileges are granted)

```sql
CREATE SYNONYM prod FOR projectuser.products;
```

Now you can access:

```sql
SELECT * FROM prod;
```

---

## 🚫 If You’re NOT a DBA or Can’t Grant

If you don’t have DBA rights, you can:

* **Ask your DBA** to run those `GRANT` statements for you
* Or just access the object directly:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM projectuser.products;
  ```

> Provided you’ve been granted `SELECT` on it.

---

## 🧠 Tip: Check Your Privileges

```sql
SELECT * FROM session_privs;
```

Look for:

* `CREATE SYNONYM`
* `SELECT ANY TABLE`

---

Would you like me to generate a script for your DBA that grants everything required?

Just tell me:

* Your current Oracle username
* Target schema name (like `projectuser`)
  And I’ll create the script.
