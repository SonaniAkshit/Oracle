## **1Ô∏è‚É£ See User‚Äôs Default Tablespace & Temporary Tablespace**

Run this as **SYS** or any account with DBA views access:

```sql
SELECT username, default_tablespace, temporary_tablespace
FROM dba_users
WHERE username = 'MYUSER';
```

> Replace `MYUSER` with your username (uppercase, unless you created it in quotes).

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ See All Tablespaces & Their Datafiles**

```sql
SELECT tablespace_name, file_name, bytes/1024/1024 AS size_mb
FROM dba_data_files
ORDER BY tablespace_name;
```

This shows:

* **tablespace\_name** ‚Üí logical storage name
* **file\_name** ‚Üí actual `.dbf` file path on disk
* **size\_mb** ‚Üí file size in MB

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ See Temporary Tablespace Files**

```sql
SELECT tablespace_name, file_name, bytes/1024/1024 AS size_mb
FROM dba_temp_files
ORDER BY tablespace_name;
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ See Which Tablespace a Specific Table Is In**

```sql
SELECT table_name, tablespace_name
FROM user_tables;
```

If you‚Äôre logged in as the owner, `user_tables` works.
If you want to check for another user‚Äôs tables:

```sql
SELECT owner, table_name, tablespace_name
FROM dba_tables
WHERE owner = 'MYUSER';
```

---

üí° **Note:**

* `dba_*` views need **DBA privileges** (e.g., SYS, SYSTEM, or `GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE`).
* The **default datafiles** in XE are usually inside:

  ```
  /opt/oracle/oradata/XE/XEPDB1/
  ```

  (on Linux)
  or

  ```
  C:\app\<user>\oradata\XE\XEPDB1\
  ```

  (on Windows).

---

If you want a **created user** in Oracle to see which **tablespace** they own or are using, they can query the data dictionary views ‚Äî but only for their own schema unless granted extra privileges.

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ As the created user (check own tablespaces)**

Every user has:

* **Default tablespace** ‚Üí where new objects are stored.
* **Temporary tablespace** ‚Üí for sorting and temp operations.

```sql
-- Shows the default and temporary tablespaces for the current user
SELECT username, default_tablespace, temporary_tablespace
FROM user_users;
```

**Example Output:**

```
USERNAME    DEFAULT_TABLESPACE   TEMPORARY_TABLESPACE
----------  -------------------  -------------------
TESTUSER    USERS                TEMP
```

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ As DBA (check any user‚Äôs tablespaces)**

If you are logged in as `SYS` or `SYSTEM`:

```sql
SELECT username, default_tablespace, temporary_tablespace
FROM dba_users
WHERE username = 'TESTUSER';
```

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Check tablespaces and datafiles**

If the user has privileges:

```sql
SELECT tablespace_name, file_name, bytes/1024/1024 AS size_mb
FROM dba_data_files
ORDER BY tablespace_name;
```

Or for temp:

```sql
SELECT tablespace_name, file_name, bytes/1024/1024 AS size_mb
FROM dba_temp_files;
```

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ If you want the created user to see tablespace info**

Grant them the needed privilege:

```sql
GRANT SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO testuser;
```

This lets them query views like `DBA_TABLESPACES` or `DBA_DATA_FILES`.
